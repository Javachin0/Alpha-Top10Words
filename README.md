# Alpha-Top10Words
Application scans text file and returns number of words, top 10 most used words and their count; as STDOUT 

After cloning, build project and execute from project directory with cli: 'dotnet run'. Application reads a .txt file from the .exe root, so put text file there if you publish (i.e. bin/release).

Don't put more than one text file in the directory or you will be told off. 

Added XUnitTest class. Execute from project directory, with the cli: 'dotnet test'
